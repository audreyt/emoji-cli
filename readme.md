# emoji-cli

Saw [@_zzak](https://twitter.com/_zzak) & [@hone02](https://twitter.com/hone02)'s talk at #rubykaigi 2015, now playing with [hone/mruby-cli](https://github.com/hone/mruby-cli). Don't mind me.

## installation, for macs only (at your own risk! :warning:)

Head to [releases](https://github.com/muan/emoji-cli/releases), download the ZIP, extract it, and place it in your `$PATH`.
